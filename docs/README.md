# VyOS Web UI Project Documentation

This repository contains comprehensive documentation for the development of a web-based user interface for VyOS, an open-source network operating system.

## Project Overview

The VyOS Web UI project aims to provide network administrators with an intuitive web interface to manage VyOS router configurations, monitor network performance, and administer system settings. This modern interface simplifies complex networking tasks while maintaining the powerful functionality of the underlying VyOS platform.
